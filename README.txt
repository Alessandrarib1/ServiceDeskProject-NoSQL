Garden Group Ticket System Project - MongoDB and C#


Example users:

Regular Employee:

username: Tudor, password: 123

Service Desk(the one who has more rights in the system):
username: ale, password: 123


WARNING: IN CASE THE PROGRAM CRASHES WHEN SELECTING "USER MANAGEMENT", UNCHECK "Break when error occurs" WHEN THE ERROR SHOWS, AND THEN THERE SHOULD BE NO ERRORS OR BUGS!


On the login design I chose the color green and a background with plants because it matches with what the Garden Group sells. Regarding functionality in the login part, the user has the option to login with his usarname and password, plus an option to get a new password through email in case they forget their login credentials. 

All the passwords are hashed and salted in the database to guarantee that the data can not be hacked as the salt is always a unique and random value. 

Service Desk employee has the option to create new users and they can let the user choose their own password or have it auto generated by the system and sent through the email as well. 

Email Generator uses the SMTP protocol as it the most common protocol to send messages between businesses and individuals and it also guarantees the delivery of the messages (as long as the email exists and is spelled correctly). 

Sort ticket by priority was done with the SORT aggregation function and PRIORITY -1 in order to sort it by descending order. 

So my parts are insuring the security of the database and making sure that the user can always get access to the application even when they forget their password.
